The idea of prison                  reform entails turning a ‘deviant’ individual into a ‘normal’ law-abiding citizen. It indicates a                 shift in the practice of imprisonment, entailing a move away from addressing the ‘physical                  body’ to addressing the ‘soul’ of a person. Ensuring that an imprisoned person   could return                 to society to lead a law–abiding and self–reliant life is a universal idea in reform programme.                         Prisons are expected to undertake human engineering. The aim is to influence and modify                 perceptions, attitudes and behaviour of those who are locked inside those highly guarded walls.                        Introducing  reformation  activities  in  Pondicherry  Prison  has  helped  prisoners  in                  inexplicable manner where people who haven’t spoken in years came out and shared their                 stories just because they were given liberty and provided a space for emotional expression.                            “In the Jail, the thieves, the murderers, the swindlers, and as I looked                        at them, I saw Vasudeva, it was Narayana whom I found in these                                          darkened souls and misused bodies...”                                                                                          - Sri Aurobindo                         Activities in the Central Prison, Kalapet                                                                                              1 │ Page","LIST OF ACTIVITIES IN THE JAIL                      1.

The session was                facilitated by Ms. Buvaneswari and Mr. Bharath from Sri Aurobindo Society, Pondicherry, and                 Sri Vidhya from Swami Vivekananda Community College, Pondicherry.                       As music has the power to transcend words and connect people, the facilitators tried to                 provide a creative space for people to move through trauma and bitter experiences. Prisoners                subjected to solitary confinement rarely have any access or scope of establishing any sort of                 association with the outside world. Therefore, by means of such sessions in the prison, we aim                 to establish connection with the inmates from every socio-economic level and race by entering                their world through music. This will lead them not only towards reformation but will also                 reintegrate them to society.                 ➢  CASE STUDY                  22 inmates were present during the session out of which one of them was a lady prisoner.                  Few of the inmates that really came out and got involved during the session were Ambrose,                 Prem, Shankar. They mentioned how comfortable and safe they felt in the space.                        •  Ambrose mentioned that it was the first time he felt a creative energy in the jail. Being                          an artistic person, he always felt the lack of motivation to do anything related to art.                           He  expressed his gratitude to the facilitators and his inmates for inspiring him to take                          an action towards his long-lost desire to create art.                       •  Prem expressed how he was able to feel an emotional connection for the first time                           within the four walls of the prison. He broke down several time while sharing how                          deeply moved he was because of the level of acceptance he felt during the entire                           session.

He explained how prison is a place that sucks out the energy out of them                           leaving the feeling sad and low all the time but he was immensely happy with how                          the session had helped him vent out all the negative energy.                  Even though many inmates were completely involved and contributed to the session, few of                 them still stood hesitant and could not open themselves to the space wherein they ended up not                engaging  much  during  the  session.  Therefore,  there  is  an  immense  need  to  conduct  such                 sessions frequently and make them feel comfortable specifically for the inmates who could not                engage much. Many prisoners also expressed the desire to include under-trial inmates and other                 convicts  during  such  sessions.  They  also  requested  the  facilitators  to  call  all  inmates                 collectively for conducting such sessions.                 ➢  OUTCOME                        Many inmates engaged themselves in the session by dancing, singing, and clapping. The                level of participation and interaction gradually improved with each song. Some of the inmates                 gradually started contributing to the session in their own way. As the session proceeded further,                one could also sense a shift in the inmate's energy and body language. Needless to say, they                 grew more comfortable and familiar with the entire concept towards the end of the session.                        Everyone  presents  during  the  session  came  together  to  create  an  environment  of                awareness, accomplishment, and a breakthrough. The session ended with a renewed belief not                 just in music as a means of healing but compassion and connection as the pillars of reformation                and reintegration.

These sessions are not only a means                 for emotional expression but more than that, it becomes an outlet for inmates to connect with                the community. The idea is to conduct a session once in every month wherein the facilitators                 create a secure environment and use music as an intervention as a modality for healing and                help the inmates lose their inhibitions and enjoy the present moment.

Her work involves reforms for                 jail inmates, especially for convicts and under trials through her art and love therapy.                       Her approach has provided a passageway for new life to hardened criminals and earned                 recognition across borders of the country and in faraway lands where her work has been used                as a template for reformation. Ms. Alokananda Roy did not follow any fixed module, plan with                 the inmates initially. Each individual inmate is different   \& require an ‘individualized’ method                 of dealing, rather than following  a generalized  trend.                       She introduced dance to the inmates so that inmates can enjoy their body, mind and soul.                 It is necessary to utilize their time and ‘raw’ energy. She channelized their raw energy through                the rhythm of music and dance. She believed that dance help inmates to harmonize with their                 own selves.                        Dance therapy has helped to inculcate a sense of discipline among the prisoners. This                music and dance therapy have brought about unimaginable psychological and physiological                 upliftment of prisoners.

The session was centered on the idea that motion and emotion are                 interconnected.  The  creative  expression  of  dance  helped  bolster  emotional  expression  and                inspired connection among the prisoners and along with that helped establish trust and faith                 within  them  to  continue  and  work  upon  themselves  to  lead  a  reformed  life.  Many  of  the                 prisoners came out to show their gratitude towards Ms. Alokananda and the entire team of Sri                Aurobindo society for accepting them and giving them the space to express themselves through                 the means of dance and music. After 15 minutes of being in the session, the spiritual divine                presence was felt in the entire room.

Specifically,  art  therapy  allows  the  inmate  to  express  him  or  herself  in  a  manner                 acceptable to both inside the prison and the outside culture.

The outcome                of the session left everyone present there in awe of the healing power of Art. The intention                 behind conducting an art therapy session was to engage the inmates who were always in a shell                and inexpressive during all the activities.                        10 prisoners were handpicked with the purpose of providing each of them a safe space.                 The opportunity of expressing themselves through the medium of art helped them to view                themselves from a different and new perspective.
