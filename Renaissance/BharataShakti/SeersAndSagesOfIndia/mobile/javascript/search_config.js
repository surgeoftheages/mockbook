The Rishi in ancient India was the                   outstanding figure with the hero just behind, while in later                  times the most striking feature is the long uninterrupted                   chain            from           Buddha                and          Mahavira                 to        Ramanuja,                  Chaitanya, Nanak, Ramdas and Tukaram and beyond                  them to Ramakrishna and Vivekananda and Dayananda.”                                               (Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 20: 246)                 The Indian mind holds that the Rishi, the seer of spiritual truth is the                               best guide not only of the religious and moral,                                                    but also the practical life.","Rishi (ऋषि) – seer                  The Sanskrit word ‘Rishi’ It comes from the root ‘Rish’, which             according to Sanskrit grammarians has two meanings, one             being ‘to go, to move’, and the other being ‘to flow, to move             near by flowing’.                  The Rishi is thus someone who ‘flows or moves or in tune             with the rhythmic flow or movement of the universe’. He is             one with the movement. He vibrates with the vibration of the             movement. He knows the whole of the movement.                 The Rishi is the one through whom the secret words of the             Veda were revealed. He is the one who had the inner sight to             see the Mantra.                  According to Sri Aurobindo, the Rishi was not the individual             composer of the hymns but the seer (draṣṭā) of an eternal             truth and an impersonal knowledge. The Rishi does not             merely see, he also hears. To his inner audience‚ the divine             word comes vibrating out of the Infinite. So, he is also called             Kavi, the hearer of Truth.                 A Rishi is the possessor of great spiritual and occult             knowledge, the complete inner knowledge.","Rishis of India                       The           founders                 of        Indian            The Rishi is the natural               culture were not ordinary                                          director of society; all the               men           or       mere            intellectual                ideals and guiding intuitions               thinkers but spiritual seers,                                      of        Indian            civilisation               are               Rishis, who lived in constant                                      attributed to the Rishis.

The values and ideals of            Indian culture are based on and evolved from these deeper            spiritual discoveries of our Rishis.","Rishi – Head of the Human World                   In the early days of the Indian civilization, the Rishi was the                 head of the human world. The deep and significant ways in                which the stamp of the Rishi was imprinted on the entire life                  and culture of the people has been described poetically by                                      Sri Aurobindo in the following passage:                 “He was at once sage, poet, priest, scientist, prophet,             educator, scholar and legislator.

Due to the                influence of her aunt, and later her husband, Maitreyi’s                 inclination towards the learning of the Vedas and other                 scriptures became more intense.                  In return, she also helped enhance the spiritual knowledge                 of her husband. About 10 hymns in the Rig Veda are                accredited to her. Later in life when Yājñavalkya took up                 sannyasa, Maitreyi too decided to lead the life of an                 ascetic. Wandering and living on alms, she spread her                knowledge among people, and contributed towards the                 composition of the ‘Maitreyi Upanishad’."];
