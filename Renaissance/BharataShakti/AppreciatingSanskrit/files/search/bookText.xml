                        Each language is the sign and power of



                        the soul of the people which naturally


                        speaks it. Each develops therefore its


                        own peculiar spirit, thought-temperament,


                        way of dealing with life and knowledge


                        and experience…. it is of the utmost value


                        to a nation, a human group-soul, to



                        preserve its language and to make of it a


                        strong and living cultural instrument.






                        A nation, race or people which loses it



                        language, cannot live its whole life or its


                        real life. And this advantage to the


                        national life is at the same time an


                        advantage to the general life of the


                        human race.

                    Sanskrit in its original form was the first and the


                    earliest vibration, pure and transparent. It was a


                    close and true transcription of the earliest experience


                    of the Supreme. It was the most direct sound-


                    formation of the manifesting Godhead. In its purity



                    and flexibility, in its wealth and depth of meaning and


                    in its adaptability and application, this was close to


                    the goddess of Speech herself.




                                                                          ***





                    In ancient times Sanskrit was simply known by the


                    name भणषण (bhāşa), a word which means language.





                    The root sound of भणषण is भणष्(bhaş), which means to


                    speak, later on it acquired the name Sanskrit. The


                    actual name for Sanskrit is संस्केम ् (sanskritam).
                                                                                               ृ

                    The root sound सम ् (sam) means totality, sum,


                    completeness, togetherness, integrity, perfectness.


                    The other word केम ् (kritam) means sculpted or
                                                             ृ


                    created. Thus, संस्केम ् (sanskritam) essentially
                                                                    ृ

                    means “sculpted to perfection”.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[SANSKRIT

            Sanskrit is a language which through its contents,


            sonority and mellifluousness, has the power to lift



            us up above ourselves – it is, as thousands of



            people would say from their own experience, a



            potent aid to the formation of character and sense



            of exaltation, in addition to ensuring a sense of pan-


            Indian cultural as well as political unity.
