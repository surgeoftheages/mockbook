Known as Sri Aurobindo's       manas-putra, about him       Sri Aurobindo is believed to       have remarked that if       Nolini doesn't understand my                                               Sketch made by The Mother        yoga, who does?                                                       renaissance.aurosociety.org","Sri Aurobindo has never concealed his opinion                      that a nation is entitled to attain its freedom by                      violence, if it can do so or if there is no other way;                      whether it should do so or not, depends on what is                      the best policy, not on ethical considerations of                      the Gandhian kind. Sri Aurobindo’s position (and                      practice) in this matter was the same as Tilak’s                      and that of other Nationalist leaders who were by                      no means Pacifists or worshippers of Ahimsa.                                                                                             Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 36: 73","Bhawani Mandir was written            by Sri Aurobindo but it was           more Barin’s idea than his. It            was not meant to train people           for assassination but for            revolutionary preparation of           the country. The idea was            soon dropped as far as Sri            Aurobindo was concerned,           but something of the kind            was attempted by Barin in           the Maniktala Garden. . .
