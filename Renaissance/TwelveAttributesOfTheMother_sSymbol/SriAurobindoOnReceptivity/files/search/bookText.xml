            Divine Force and to feel its presence




             and the presence of the Mother in it

              If this power and presence can be felt and this

         I have often used the




         Force alone without any




         human instrument or



         outer means, but here all




         depends on the recipient




         and his receptivity




         —unless as in the case of




         many healers there are




         unseen beings or powers




         that assist.
