It  is  the  flower-artist,  the  man  who  is  skilled  in                        arranging flowers.                                The  master  of  the  house  brings  a  tray  with  some                       flowers, a pair of scissors, a knife, a little saw, and a                       beautiful vase.","","“Sir,” he says, “I cannot make a bouquet                      beautiful enough for such a beautiful                      vase.”                                 “I am sure you can,” replies the master                      politely as he leaves the room.                               Left alone, the artist sets to work, cutting,                      snipping, twisting and tying until a                      beautiful bunch of flowers fills the vase—a                      delight to the eyes.","","The  master  and  his  friends  enter  the                        room;  the  artist  stands  to  one  side  and                        murmurs, “My bouquet is too poor, let it                       be taken away.”                                    “No,” replies the master, “it is good.”","","To one side of the table, near                                the vase, the artist has left a                                pair of scissors.                                         By this he means that if                                there is any flaw in the                                 bouquet, anyone can take the                                scissors and cut away what                                offends the eye.","","The artist has done a fine piece of work, but he                                  would not dream of exalting its merits. He admits                                 that he may have made mistakes. He is modest.                                         Perhaps the Japanese artist really thinks that his                                 work deserves compliments. I cannot tell his                                  thoughts. But at any rate he does not boast and                                  his behaviour is pleasing.","","The flowers in the vase are                            beautifully arranged and our eyes                             are delighted. But it is for us and                             not for the artist to praise them.
