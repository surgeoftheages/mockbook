               It  is  the  flower-artist,  the  man  who  is  skilled  in








               arranging flowers.
















               The  master  of  the  house  brings  a  tray  with  some







               flowers, a pair of scissors, a knife, a little saw, and a







               beautiful vase.]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[“Sir,” he says, “I cannot make a bouquet







              beautiful enough for such a beautiful







              vase.”

















               “I am sure you can,” replies the master







              politely as he leaves the room.
















              Left alone, the artist sets to work, cutting,







              snipping, twisting and tying until a







              beautiful bunch of flowers fills the vase—a







              delight to the eyes.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="7"><![CDATA[The  master  and  his  friends  enter  the









              room;  the  artist  stands  to  one  side  and









              murmurs, “My bouquet is too poor, let it








              be taken away.”




















               “No,” replies the master, “it is good.”]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[To one side of the table, near









                      the vase, the artist has left a









                      pair of scissors.


















                      By this he means that if









                      there is any flaw in the










                      bouquet, anyone can take the









                      scissors and cut away what









                      offends the eye.]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[The artist has done a fine piece of work, but he







                          would not dream of exalting its merits. He admits






                          that he may have made mistakes. He is modest.














                          Perhaps the Japanese artist really thinks that his






                          work deserves compliments. I cannot tell his







                          thoughts. But at any rate he does not boast and







                          his behaviour is pleasing.]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="13"><![CDATA[The flowers in the vase are






                     beautifully arranged and our eyes







                     are delighted. But it is for us and







                     not for the artist to praise them.
