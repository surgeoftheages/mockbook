If one were a man who did not                              accept any kind of compromise, one                                  could not remain in politics; one                             would quite simply be pushed out by                                              the very force of things.                                 There will be a time when all this                                              will change, but not yet.","Politics is perhaps the last                                        thing which will change.                               There are many others which                                      must change before. It is                                      certainly one of the most                                               recalcitrant things.","There are two things which it is                                       very difficult to change:                                    FINANCE AND POLITICS;                          the field of money and the field of                               government are the two points                             where man is weakest and most                                          attached to falsehood.                          So, probably, transformation will come                                                       there last of all.","One can hope for a social                                  transformation, an economic                                                     transformation,                                                a transformation of                                    education; one can hope for                                            all this long before the                                       transformation of politics                                                  and of finance. ...","Perhaps the first thing that will be                              transformed will be the scientific                            world, it is possible; because there                               a very great sincerity is required                                   and a very persevering effort,                                   and these already are qualities                                            which open for you the                                            door to a higher life. . .                                             THE MOTHER, CWM, 7: 297-98","THE CONDITIONS TO ORGANISE                                — to be an organiser (it’s not “to                                            govern,” it’s to organise)                           — the conditions to be an organiser                                                       should be these:                                                      no more desires,                                               no more preferences,                                                 no more attractions,                                                 no more repulsions                               — a perfect equality for all things.","Sincerity, of course, but that goes                              without saying: wherever insincerity                            enters, poison enters at the same time.                             And then, only those who are themselves                                            in that condition can discern                                        whether another is in it or not.","At present, all human organisations are                                                               based on:                                                        the visible fact                                              (which is a falsehood),                               public opinion (another falsehood),                                                     and moral sense,                                         which is a third falsehood!
