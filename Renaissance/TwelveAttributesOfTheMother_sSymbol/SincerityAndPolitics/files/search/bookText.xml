                                                     true politician?





                                 If one were a man who did not




                         accept any kind of compromise, one



                              could not remain in politics; one




                        would quite simply be pushed out by




                                         the very force of things.



                             There will be a time when all this




                                         will change, but not yet.]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[Politics is perhaps the last





                                  thing which will change.





                         There are many others which





                                must change before. It is





                                certainly one of the most





                                         recalcitrant things.]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[There are two things which it is



                                   very difficult to change:




                               FINANCE AND POLITICS;




                     the field of money and the field of




                          government are the two points




                        where man is weakest and most



                                      attached to falsehood.




                     So, probably, transformation will come



                                                   there last of all.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[One can hope for a social




                             transformation, an economic

                                           a transformation of




                               education; one can hope for




                                       all this long before the




                                  transformation of politics

                         transformed will be the scientific




                       world, it is possible; because there




                          a very great sincerity is required




                              and a very persevering effort,





                             and these already are qualities




                                       which open for you the

                            — to be an organiser (it’s not “to




                                       govern,” it’s to organise)



                       — the conditions to be an organiser




                                                  should be these:




                                                 no more desires,



                                           no more preferences,




                                            no more attractions,



                                             no more repulsions




                          — a perfect equality for all things.]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[Sincerity, of course, but that goes




                         without saying: wherever insincerity




                       enters, poison enters at the same time.




                        And then, only those who are themselves




                                       in that condition can discern



                                    whether another is in it or not.]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[At present, all human organisations are




                                                          based on:



                                                    the visible fact



                                          (which is a falsehood),




                          public opinion (another falsehood),



                                                 and moral sense,



                                     which is a third falsehood!
