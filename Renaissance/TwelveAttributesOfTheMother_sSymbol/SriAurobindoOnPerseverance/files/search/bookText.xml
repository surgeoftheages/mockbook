                    WORDS OF SRI AUROBINDO]]></page><page Index="2"><![CDATA[A Yoga like this needs patience,




            because it means a change both of



          the radical motives and of each part




                              and detail of the nature.





                                (Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 112)]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[A mere restless dissatisfaction with the



         ordinary life is not a sufficient preparation for


           this Yoga. A positive inner call, a strong will



                and a great steadiness are necessary for


                                  success in the spiritual life.

                nor does prolonged difficulty mean that for



                               oneself the thing is impossible.

                result at once are natural to the human




                      vital; it is by firm confidence in the




                        Mother that they will disappear.

             surrender does not matter,

              steps, if need be, do actually march faster
