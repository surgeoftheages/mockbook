(Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 112)","A mere restless dissatisfaction with the             ordinary life is not a sufficient preparation for              this Yoga. A positive inner call, a strong will                    and a great steadiness are necessary for                                     success in the spiritual life.                                                                       ~ Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 27-28","A stumble does not mean that one is unfit,                     nor does prolonged difficulty mean that for                                   oneself the thing is impossible.                                                   (Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 113)",". . . perseverance in the path is the one rule                            to cling to and with that finally all                                         obstacles are overcome.                                        ~ Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 111","Impatience and overeagerness for the                     result at once are natural to the human                           vital; it is by firm confidence in the                             Mother that they will disappear.                                                (Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 111)","Whether by tapasya or                   surrender does not matter,                 the one thing is to be firm in               setting one’s face to the goal.                                 (Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 118)",". . . people who are grateful and cheerful                   and ready to go step by step, even by slow                   steps, if need be, do actually march faster                          and more surely than those who are                      impatient and in haste and at each step                                                despair or murmur.                                            ~ Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 29: 112",". . . the one thing that is essential is the inner                call and aspiration and the perseverance to                follow always after it no matter how long it                            takes or what are the difficulties or                    impediments—because nothing else will                                        satisfy the soul within us.                                          ~ Sri Aurobindo, CWSA 35: 230","For more such inspiring quick reads,                                                   visit the website of                                                 Renaissance Journal:                                       https://journal.aurobharati.in/"];
