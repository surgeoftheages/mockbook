What is true of the man, is true also of the nation.             The country, the land is only the outward body of the           nation, its annamaya kosh, or gross physical body; the mass             of people, the life of millions who occupy and vivify the           body of the nation with their presence, is the pranamaya            kosh, the life-body of the nation. These two are the gross            body, the physical manifestation of the Mother.

This is as much a part of the Mother’s life as the         outward existence which is visible to the physical eyes.
