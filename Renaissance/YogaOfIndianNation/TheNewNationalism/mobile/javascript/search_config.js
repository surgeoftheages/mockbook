What is true of the man, is true also of the nation              The country, the land is only the outward body of the            nation, its annamaya kosh, or gross physical body; the mass            of people, the life of millions who occupy and vivify the            body of the nation with their presence, is the pranamaya            kosh, the life-body of the nation. These two are the gross            body, the physical manifestation of the Mother.

This is as much a part of the Mother’s life as the         outward existence which is visible to the physical eyes.                                                                                                        Continued on next page...","This subtle life of the nation again springs from             a deeper existence in the causal body of the             nation, the peculiar temperament which it has             developed out of its ages of experience and             which makes it distinct from others.

Aurobindo, CWSA, 7: 1110","Nationalism is not a mere political                           programme; Nationalism is a religion                            that has come from God; Nationalism                             is a creed in which you shall have to                            live. Let no man dare to call himself a                            Nationalist if he does so merely with a                           sort of intellectual pride, thinking that                           he is more patriotic, thinking that he                          is something higher than those who do                               not call themselves by that name.                                                                                     Continued on next page....","If you are going to be a Nationalist, if you are           going to assent to this religion of Nationalism,          you must do it in the religious spirit. You must            remember that you are the instrument of God          for the salvation of your own country. You must            live as the instruments of God.                                                                                            Sri Aurobindo, CWSA, 7: 818-819"];
