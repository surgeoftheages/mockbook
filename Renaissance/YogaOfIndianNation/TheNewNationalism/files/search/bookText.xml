              What is true of the man, is true also of the nation.


          The country, the land is only the outward body of the nation, its

         annamaya kosh, or gross physical body; the mass of people, the life


        of millions who occupy and vivify the body of the nation with their


               presence, is the pranamaya kosh, the life-body of the nation.


           These two are the gross body, the physical manifestation of the Mother.]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[Within the gross body is a subtler body, the thoughts,



     the literature, the philosophy, the mental and



     emotional activities, the sum of hopes, pleasures,



     aspirations, fulfilments, the civilisation and culture,


     which make up the sukshma sharir of the nation.



     This is as much a part of the Mother’s life as the



     outward existence which is visible to the physical eyes.





                                                                                                  Continued on next page...]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[This subtle life of the



    nation again springs from



     a deeper existence in the



    causal body of the nation,



    the peculiar temperament



   which it has developed out



     of its ages of experience



            and which makes it



          distinct from others.

              the separate life of the millions who people the



          country, but we mean also a separate culture and



               civilisation, a peculiar national temperament



          which has become too deeply rooted to be altered


         and in all these we discover a manifestation of God



         in national life which is living, sacred and adorable.
