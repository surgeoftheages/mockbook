SHIVAJI               For the fruit I did not work and by the failure I              am not amazed nor discouraged.","renaissance_sas           JAYSINGH                                                                                                   journal.aurobharati.in             Neither did I work for a reward, but to uphold the             ideal of the Rajput. Unflinching courage in            honourable warfare, chivalry to friend and foe, a             noble loyalty to the sovereign of my choice, this             seemed to me the true Indian tradition, preferable            even to the unity and predominance of the Hindu             races.              Therefore I could not accept your overtures. But I            gave you the opportunity to accept my own             tradition and, when faith was not kept with either             of us, I saved my honour and assisted your escape.","renaissance_sas                                                                                                                     journal.aurobharati.in          SHIVAJI             God extended to me His protection and             moved the heart of a woman to give me love              and aid. Traditions change. The ideal of the             Rajput has its future, but the mould had to             be broken in order that what was temporary              in it might pass. Loyalty to the sovereign of             my choice, that is good; but loyalty to the             sovereign of my nation’s choice, that is              better.","renaissance_sas                                                                                                                     journal.aurobharati.in                  The monarch is divine by the power of God              expressed within him, but he has the power             because he is the incarnation of the people.             God in the nation is the deity of which the              monarch must be the servant and the             devotee.
