Hence if we want to survive, if we have the                slightest desire to be free from an eternal hell,                 our first duty is to serve the nation.

If we do not               attempt this, we may as well give up our desire to                  create an Indian nation altogether; for without                        such a discipline nationalism, patriotism,               regeneration are mere words and ideas which can               never become a part of the very soul of the nation                  and never therefore a great realised fact.
