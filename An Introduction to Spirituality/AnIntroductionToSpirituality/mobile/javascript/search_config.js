Spirituality should not be misunderstood. Many of us            do not know that there is a difference between Religion            and Spirituality and it is essential to realise the difference.            All of us have grown up with one religion or the other.            Religion  has  no  doubt  established  God  in  our  lives.  We            have become aware of God through our parents and have            accompanied them to temples, mosques and churches as            the case may be. Religion was never started by the original            saint; it was turned into religion by the disciples later on            and then as time passed the message, which was originally            spiritual, got lost and we got involved in the surface part            of religion which is as it stands today — full of rites and            rituals without much substance. However, religion has            played a role but the time has come to go beyond religion            and reach the Spirit. Religion, as Sri Aurobindo says, is like            a scaffolding which is used to construct a building and dis-            carded once the building is completed. The time of religion            is gone and we have to go beyond it.             What is spirituality? Spirituality is related to the Spirit,            what we call the soul. Each one has a soul which is the            spark of God in all of us. In other words, the individual            soul is a part of the Universal Soul. Who is God? God is            not a person who sits on a throne somewhere in the skies.            He is Absolute and total Perfection, a Perfect Force which                                      2","permeates this world and guides its destiny.                The question, therefore, arises is that if God is total            perfection and He resides within us then why are we not            perfect. The reason is that we are not even aware of our            soul. Our involvement today is more with the surface life            which is governed by three levels of consciousness — the            mental, emotional and the physical. We have a mind which            observes, thinks, analyses, remembers and is the best in-            strument available to us today on which we rely heavily.            Secondly, we live on an emotional level and it is through            the heart that we feel emotions such as love, hate, envy            etc. Lastly, there is the physical consciousness which gov-            erns the body. To most of us the body is perhaps the most            important thing. This is something which all our five senses            are aware of — touch, taste, smell, sight, hearing. We are            so involved in these three levels that we are completely            unaware most of the time of our soul which lives within us            and is not reachable by the five senses. Because we are not            aware of the Spirit within we are cut off from perfection            and that is why our lives are so imperfect. It is because            of this reason that since time immemorial effort is being            made to find our soul, unite with it, so that our lives can            become perfect.                Living at these levels of consciousness we find that            our lives are full of friction and struggle. There is no peace            in any relationship - individual, community or nations. The            reason is that the mind, the emotional being and the body            are  not  in  harmony  with  each  other.  Mind  pulls  in  one            direction, the heart in another and the body has its own                                      3","demands. If an individual is not at peace with himself he            cannot have a harmonious relationship with others. This            is the crux of the problem. It is also clear that it is not pos-            sible for the mind, the heart and the body to come to a            peaceful arrangement. It seems that they are like fighting            children who cannot get along. The only way is that they            come under the control of the Spirit within. As the Spirit            comes forward and begins to influence more and more it            unifies the mind, heart and the body. As the three levels of            consciousness come under the light of the Spirit we will            find that there is harmony within us leading to a progres-            sive harmony outside.             How to go about this? Let us first start with the mind.            Don't get confused between the mind and the brain. Mind            is a consciousness and brain is the physical part just like            the heart is the physical part of the emotional conscious-            ness and the body of the physical consciousness. We are            at present talking of the mind. The habit of the mind is to            produce thoughts. It cannot sit quiet. Moreover, the mind            does not have the capacity to look at things in totality. It is            like looking through a keyhole which shows us a very small            part of the picture and we think it is the full picture. Each            one of us looks through his own keyhole and that leads            to friction because each one of us sees a different 'total-            ity'. Mind, therefore, has to be quietened, expanded and            finally elevated. A question was put to Sri Aurobindo by            a sadhak that if one's mind is not still then how does one            meditate and follow the spiritual life which requires steadi-            ness and equilibrium. Sri Aurobindo said that in the initial                                       4","stages two things should be done. First we should always            try and remember the Mother or whoever  your God is -            Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha, Christ etc. Visualise the Mother in            your heart and remember Her. Remembrance is easier than            meditation. Secondly, take a concentrated attitude for a            few minutes  calling the  Mother's presence  daily.  These            two practices will definitely quieten the mind and pave the            way for a concentrated meditation.                One can remember the Mother while carrying out the            natural activities like eating, sleeping, walking, bathing etc.            If, along with remembering the Mother, we offer our actions            to Her every activity becomes spiritual. In Sri Aurobindo's            yoga it is not necessary to go to temples to unite with            God. It can be done here and now through the activities of            life provided the attitude is right and the aspiration is strong.               Secondly, be careful about what  you read because            when one reads one comes into contact with the con-            sciousness of the writer. It is, therefore, necessary to read            beautiful, uplifting books especially when one is going to            sleep as the vibration continues throughout the night.               Coming to the emotional level we come into contact            with contrary emotions and opposites which we find dif-            ficult to control. We are a mixed bag and our emotions            also are mixed. The heart must be channelised in the right            direction which is devotion to the Mother or whoever your            deity is. A conscious effort should be made to love God            through devotion and bhakti. If one cannot control one's            emotions one must offer them to God and seek His help                                       5","and guidance. This will lead to purification of the heart and            stabilise the emotional being.                Lastly, we come to the  physical level i.e. the body.            Body is matter. Take life out of it and it is inert. But even            something as gross as the body has to be awakened as            otherwise the spiritual life cannot become integral. This is            not an easy task. The body has the vibrations of matter,            plant and animal gathered over millions of years. The body            is a very difficult instrument to be awakened. But an effort            has to be made to prepare it and for that the body also            must pray. It sounds rather strange since the body cannot            think then how can it pray? If our physical actions are con-            secrated to God the body also begins to pray. We must            remember that the body, like the mind and the heart, is            an instrument of the soul. As far as asanas are concerned,            when you start them it should be with an attitude of offer-            ing to the Lord. That is why asanas are called yogasanas.            Yoga means union. Therefore, an asana which is done as            a consecration to God is yogasana. If consecration is not            there it is only an exercise and will have a limited effect.            What we must remember is that the body too has a role to            play in spiritual life. In some of the olden traditions of spir-            ituality the body was not given much importance. What            was important was to receive gyan through the mind and            bhakti through the heart. But in Sri Aurobindo 's yoga the            body has an equal importance as ultimately the destiny of            the body is to be transformed into a divine body.                In order to prepare the body for the ultimate transfor-            mation it is no doubt important to exercise. But it is equal-                                      6","ly important to avoid doing those things which harm the            body such as smoking, consuming alcohol etc. Sometimes            habits die hard; but if our aspiration is strong and we offer            the problem to the Mother sincerely it is possible to get rid            of bad habits. One should not give up the effort.                A question arises as to why should we have to call God            as He is omniscient and omnipresent. Here we must under-            stand that calling is a part of the relationship between God            and the human being. Even Draupadi, who was so close to            Krishna, had to call Him before He appeared and protected            her.                There is a misconception that spirituality is for the old.            Spiritual life has nothing to do with age and the sooner we            start the better it is. Life is like a slate where one writes all            accounts of experiences, most of them of not much value.            By the time we are old the slate is full and when we realize            that what we have written on the slate is not of any value            it is too late and most of the balance period one wastes in            rubbing off the slate. Therefore, start now and write the            correct thing on your slate.               A couple of things more . One must understand the            importance of prayer. Prayer is not a crutch. Prayer is a            movement of surrender. A prayer is like the physical ex-            pression of 's1sht1ng' when you bow before God in sup-            plication. So pray as much as you can. It is a most powerful            way of connecting yourself to God.                Similarly mantra. A repetition of the mantra links you            to the deity to whom the mantra is dedicated. There are                                      7","hundreds of mantras of Lord Ganesha. As soon as  you            start chanting that mantra either loudly or silently it imme-            diately links you with the consciousness of Ganesha, the            remover of all difficulties. Mantra must be repeated slowly            and consciously so that it vibrates in your being.               For those of us who are dedicated to the Mother the            most powerful mantra is : Om Anandamayi, Chaitanya-            mayi, Satyamayi Parame.             Remembrance or smaran creates a direct link with the            Divine. Mother told us that when you remember God be            sure that He remembers you. This creates a lasting rela-            tionship of love and protection between man and God.             The advice that the Mother gives us all :             'In all pursuits, intellectual or active,  your one motto            should be, \"Remember and Offer.\" Let whatever you do be            done as an offering to the Divine. And this too will be an            excellent discipline for you; it will prevent you from doing            many foolish and useless things.'                It is spirituality when you begin to become aware of                 another consciousness than the ego                 and begin to live in it or under its influence                 more and more.             It is that consciousness                 wide, infinite, self-existent, pure of ego etc., which                 is called Spirit (Self, Brahman, Divine)...
